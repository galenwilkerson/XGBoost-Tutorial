# XGBoost Tutorial

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on XGBoost, demonstrating how to use it with the Titanic dataset. The tutorial includes an intuitive explanation of how XGBoost works, a detailed step-by-step guide, and visualizations of decision trees used in the XGBoost process.

## Repository Structure

- `Tutorial on XGBoost.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the XGBoost tutorial, explanations, and visualizations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/XGBoost-Tutorial.git
   cd XGBoost-Tutorial
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**

   Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` does not exist, manually install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost graphviz matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open the Jupyter Notebook to follow along with the tutorial and execute the code cells:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Tutorial on XGBoost.ipynb"
   ```

## Tutorial Overview

The tutorial covers the following:

1. **Intuitive Explanation**: Understand the concept of XGBoost and how it works through a simple analogy.
2. **Detailed Walkthrough**: Learn the steps involved in training an XGBoost model, including data preprocessing and model training.
3. **Visualizations**: See how XGBoost builds and uses decision trees to make predictions. The tutorial includes visualizations of three small decision trees to illustrate the boosting process.

### Data Preprocessing

The Titanic dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Training and Visualization

- **Tree 1**: The first tree is trained on the `Age` feature.
- **Tree 2**: The second tree focuses on the `Fare` feature to correct errors from the first tree.
- **Tree 3**: The third tree uses the `Pclass` feature to further refine the predictions.

The visualizations show how each tree contributes to improving the model's performance.

### Example Output

The notebook demonstrates the accuracy of the final model and displays the decision trees inline.
